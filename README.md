## ⚙️ Project Overview

*Ghost Lights* is a **solo-developed gameplay tech demo** created to explore core systems for a 2D multiplayer action-platformer. Set in a haunted amusement park, players use colored light-based abilities to interact with enemies and environments in dynamic ways.

The project focuses on building a **playable foundation** for multiplayer combat, character systems, and UI.

## 🧠 Role & Focus Areas

This project was built entirely by me as a demonstration of technical and design skills in gameplay and UI engineering.

### 🔧 Gameplay Systems
- Designed and implemented the **color-interaction mechanic**: enemies respond differently to player light color.
- Developed player movement, input handling, and hit detection using Blueprint.
- Integrated **PaperZD** for animation state machines with sprite-based characters.

### 🔌 Networking & Architecture
- Configured and implemented core **multiplayer networking logic**:
  - Replication of character states, light effects, and player interactions.
  - Synchronized multiplayer session flow through custom `GameMode`, `GameState`, and `PlayerController`.

### 🖥️ UI/UX Engineering
- Built the **UI layout** system including:
  - **Lobby screen** with synced character selection.
  - **In-game HUD** showing health and active colors.
